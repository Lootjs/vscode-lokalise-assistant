# Lokalise Assistant Extension for Visual Studio Code

Lokalise Assistant is a powerful extension for Visual Studio Code that streamlines the process of working with translations by integrating with Lokalise, a popular localization and translation management platform. This extension is designed to make it easier for developers to fetch, compare, and synchronize translations between Lokalise and local JSON files directly within the VS Code.

## Key Features

- **Fetch Translations**: Automatically download translations from Lokalise.
- **Compare Translations**: Easily compare Lokalise translations with your local JSON files.
- **Exclude Specific Tags**: Filter out translations containing specified tags, offering more control over the data you synchronize.
- **Streamline Localization Workflow**: Simplify the process of managing translations, saving time and reducing errors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Lokalise account with access to your project's API token.

### Setup

1. **Obtain the API Token from Lokalise**: Log into your Lokalise account and navigate to the API tokens section to create or copy your API token.

2. **Configure the Extension**: In Visual Studio Code, go to the extension settings and enter your Lokalise API token.

3. **Specify the Lokalise Project ID**:
   - Open the Lokalise Assistant panel in VS Code.
   - Enter the ID of your Lokalise project. You can find the project ID in the Lokalise web interface URL while viewing your project.

4. **Customize Your Workflow**:
   - Optionally, in the extension settings, specify tags to exclude certain translations from being fetched or compared.

## Benefits for Developers

- **Efficient Localization Management**: Manage translations directly within your development environment, eliminating the need to switch between different tools.
- **Real-time Comparison**: Instantly see how your local translations stack up against those in Lokalise, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **Customizable Filtering**: Exclude translations with specific tags to focus on the most relevant content for your project.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to fit naturally into your VS Code workflow, enhancing productivity without disrupting your development process.
